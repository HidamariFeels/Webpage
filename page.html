		<h1>Welcome to the HidamariFeels webpage.</h1>
		<p>For a long time, I've been thinking about how I haven't really been able to put anything out there, and I've come to realise how important it is to have some kind of project to work towards, when there's an end goal in mind there's a source of motivation that doesn't feel contrived, that doesn't feel... painful to commit to. I will be hosting any projects that I'm working on within this webpage, as well as which platforms you can find me on, I am also considering starting a blog, or two, or three, or four, etc. Gotta make the most of the summer...</p>

		<p>Before this year's exam season (2025), I'd really started to develop a passion for visual novels, I've been reading more and more these days, and I've become inspired to collaborate with a friend and create our own story, that maybe we can look back on in the future, and laugh at, or be surprised that it might have actually been any good. I want to keep things relatively simple, a soulful attempt that could bring my old writings to life, now with the influence of many real life experiences, as well as stories that I've come across through what I've played, what I've read, what I've watched, I'd want to contribute at least something to the incessant flow of art and its progression.</p>

		<p>And now that we're finally here (I'm writing this a few hours after the end of my last exam for the academic year), I'm excited to work more on this project, and it's something I'll dedicate a lot of my time towards.</p>

		<p>Aside from that, I have noticed that my passion for programming has been, yet to be unleashed, or at least it's sort of just waiting for a good idea to crop up, there's effort behind this stuff, lots of it, even the creation of this minimalist webpage gives me an intense burst of motivation, I want to improve, I want to create something that I can be impressed with, I want to play my part, I don't feel like succumbing to my old ways of helplessness any longer, I'm being a little dramatic... but my point is that I want to put myself out there a little more.</p>
